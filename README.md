# Why Is This?

As a developer picking website colors can be quite a challenge, so I decided to create a tool that uses the same color concept as [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), but also generates an entire palette from a single base color. I also had to generate the code for both Tailwind and CSS so I could use it in multiple projects.

I hope you find this tool useful. If you&apos;re curious to read a bit more about how I built this, check out my [blog](https://www.jaredmakes.com/blog/creating-a-simple-palette-generator).
